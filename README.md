Hostside is a simple webside seen above, where a live visualization of the frekvens panels are shown. Code can be written direclty under controlling the led matrixes througth the pixel array. Once code in box compiles, it will run and be sent to the to physical ikea frekvens panels.
The panels have been modded, in the process of which the factory controlboard replaced with an ESP8266 running espurino.
